1) Exercise One: In this lab, we will create a Spring Boot application and we will utilize some core Spring Boot annotations such as @controller, @RequestMapping, and @GetMapping. 
Perform an step-by-step exercise to build a basic application using Spring Boot, developing an application using the spring initializr.
2) Exercise 2: In this lab, we will use @Requestbody, @PostMapping, and @RestController annotations, and PostMan for sending data. You can either create a new Spring Project by using Spring initializr, or you can continue the previous Exercise (309.5 - AC3 - How to use - @Controller, @RequestMapping and @GetMapping).
