1) Exercise One: Create a Spring Boot application and we will utilize some core Spring Boot annotations such as @controller, @RequestMapping, and @GetMapping. Perform an step-by-step exercise to build a basic application using Spring Boot, developing an application using the spring initializr.
2) Exercise Two: Use @Requestbody, @PostMapping, and @RestController annotations, and PostMan for sending data. You can either create a new Spring Project by using Spring initializr, or you can continue the previous Exercise (309.5 - AC3 - How to use - @Controller, @RequestMapping and @GetMapping).
3) Exercise Three: Send data from the controller to the template (HTML) by using model, ModelAndView, and @Modelattribute Annotation. In order to do that, we will use Thymeleaf. We will explore more about Thymeleaf later in this lab. There are four examples in this lab. Explain how to send data from the controller to the template (HTML) using the model, ModelAndView, and @Modelattribute annotations.
4) Exercise Four: Discuss Spring forms and data binding to a controller then have a look at some of the main annotations in Spring Boot (e.g., @RestController, @ModelAttribute, @PostMapping, @GetMapping).
5) Exercise Five: Demonstrate how to use @RequestParam annotation. Learners will be able to utilize the @RequestParam annotation.
